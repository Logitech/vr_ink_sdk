## Logitech Stylus Support in SteamVR 
### Status Today
The Logitech Stylus wil is still in development and as such doesn't support all the latest feature from OpenVR and SteamVR:
- In SteamVR Home the Logitech Stylus is not displayed, instead you will see a Vive Controller. If you want to see the Stylus render you need to be in the **shell**
- The Stylus is not fully supported in SteamVR Input 2.0, as such when looking at creating a specific binding for the stylus you would be greeted by this:

- The Logitech Stylus suffers from the same issue as existing Vive or Knuckles controller regarding LED status and other charging problem 
- Right now the Nib of the Stylus and the Primary button are using the same channel to report their analog values. 
### Future support
We are working to get the pen fully integrated in OpenVR ecosystem and we will address all the previous concerns for our launch.
Here is a sneak peek of the progress:
