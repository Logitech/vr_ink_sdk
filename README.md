# What is the Logitech VR Ink SDK

[Logitech VR Ink Pilot Edition](https://www.logitech.com/en-roeu/promo/vr-ink.html) is a first-generation VR stylus for enterprise, coming later this year. Simple to use from the moment you pick it up, it offers control and precision, unleashing your creativity in VR, on two-dimensional physical surfaces or in three-dimensional room-scale space. This SDK will allow your VR app to take advantage of all the features of VR Ink.

Here you will find:

- A guide to getting started, including initial installation.
- How to integrate with Unity, Unreal, or your own platform.
- Recommended design guidelines for VR Ink.
- A set of example interaction blocks.
