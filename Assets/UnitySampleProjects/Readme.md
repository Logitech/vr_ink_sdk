## Design Guidelines

We recommend that you follow [these design guidelines](../../Documentation/DesignGuidelines) when integrating or creating interactions for the VR Ink. You can find examples of their implementation in the [VR Ink Toolkit](../../Assets/Toolkit).

# Logitech VR Ink Unity Integration

We are aware that many applications have yet to make the jump to the new SteamVR 2.0 Input system. We have decided to provide two different samples using the both the new system and the old legacy SteamVR approach.

## Using Legacy SteamVR
SteamVR has moved to implement the OpenXR standard with the SteamVR 2.0 Input mapping. If your application is still using the legacy SteamVR approach [SteamVR Plugin](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steamvr_unity_plugin/releases/tag/1.2.3), our legacy SteamVR Unity sample will help you integrate the VR Ink.
[Get started here](./UnitySample_LegacySteamVR).

## Using SteamVR 2.0 Input System
If your project is using the SteamVR 2.0 input system, you can use our SteamVR 2.0 Unity sample to integrate the VR Ink.
