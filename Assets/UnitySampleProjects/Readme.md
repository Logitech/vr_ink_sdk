# Logitech VR Ink Unity Integration

We are aware that many applications have yet to make the jump to the new SteamVR 2.0 Input system. We have decided to provide two different samples using the both the new system and the old legacy SteamVR approach.

## Using Legacy SteamVR
SteamVR has moved to implement the OpenXR standard, this leads to the creation of the new SteamVR2.0 Input mapping. If your application is still using the legacy SteamVR approach [SteamVR Plugin](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steamvr_unity_plugin/releases/tag/1.2.3) the sample code in that project will help you integrate the stylus simply and effortlessly.
